                            Your storage cluster utilization has crossed 80% and will become read-only at 85% utilized! Please free up some space or if possible expand the storage cluster immediately to prevent any service access issues. It is common to also be alerted to OSD devices entering near-full or full states prior to this alert.

                            The utilization of an OSD in your cluster has exceeded 75%. Please free up some space or expand the storage cluster if possible. If the OSD reaches 85% utilization it will enter a read-only state and service interruptions are possible.

                            The utilization of an OSD in your cluster has exceeded 80%. Please free up some space immediately or expand the storage cluster if possible. Failure to address this issue will lead to service interruptions for the cluster.
